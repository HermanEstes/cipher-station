# node; on a thinly-peered box that is slow and, for large objects, routinely
# truncates mid-body — which surfaces on iOS as "network connection lost".)
#
# Two things keep this from being an open IPFS proxy:
#   1. require_owner — only the station owner's own paired delegate devices.
#   2. station_owns_cid — only CIDs this station published (see manifest.py).
# The read is local in the way that matters, but not by fiat: only-if-cached is
# evaluated at the ROOT, so a root we lack is a fast 404 and never a pull, while
# a cached root with absent children would still fetch them over bitswap. What
# makes that unreachable is the set above — the station added and recursively
# pinned everything station_owns_cid admits, so it holds the whole DAG. Widen
# that set to content the station did not pin and this stops being true.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# FETCH — arbitrary CIDs through the station's own IPFS node
#
# GET /content/{cid} deliberately refuses anything this station did not
# publish. This route is its counterpart for everything else: a paired
# delegate asks the STATION to fetch a CID over its own libp2p connections
# (bitswap/DHT) and stream the bytes back — bypassing public HTTP gateways
# entirely. Public gateways rate-limit (429), truncate large bodies, and
# cold-fetch through their own thin peerings; the station's node is often
# better-connected to the content (it may even be the provider).
#
# Threat model / blast-radius controls:
#   1. require_owner        — same ML-DSA device auth as /content. This is
#                             not an open proxy; only the owner's paired
#                             devices can drive it.
#   2. FETCH_ENABLED        — operators who don't want their station
#                             fetching third-party content can turn the
#                             whole route into a 404 with one env var.
#   3. FETCH_MAX_BYTES      — object size is checked (files/stat) BEFORE
#                             any content blocks are pulled; oversized CIDs
#                             are refused with 413 and never touch the store.
#   4. FETCH_PIN=false      — fetched blocks land as CACHE, not pins; the
#                             next `repo gc` reclaims them. Nothing a
#                             delegate fetches can silently grow the
#                             permanent footprint unless the operator
#                             opts in to pinning. When they do, the pin is
#                             taken AFTER the full stream has been delivered
#                             (blocks are local by then, so it is cheap) —
#                             never before the first byte.
#   5. FETCH_TIMEOUT        — a dead/unroutable CID costs one bounded wait
#                             at the size gate (no retries: "nobody provides
#                             this" is not transient), not a worker pinned
#                             forever.
#   6. FETCH_MAX_CONCURRENT — this route is synchronous, so every in-flight
#                             fetch occupies a threadpool worker for its DHT
#                             walk + stream. A bounded semaphore caps that;
#                             beyond it the answer is 503 + Retry-After, so a
#                             burst of slow fetches cannot starve /post,
#                             /rewrap and friends of workers.
